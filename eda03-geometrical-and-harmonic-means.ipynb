They are used in situations where the data is non-normal or the distribution of the data is skewed.\n","\n","Here are some examples of when to use geometric and harmonic means in EDA:\n","\n","1. Geometric Mean: \n","The geometric mean is used when the data is logarithmically distributed. For example, suppose we want to analyze the growth rate of a particular species of bacteria over time. The data may show an exponential growth pattern, which means that the bacteria population is growing at a constant rate over time. In this case, we can use the geometric mean to calculate the average growth rate of the bacteria population over time.\n","\n","2. Harmonic Mean: \n","The harmonic mean is used when the data is rate-based or has a reciprocal relationship. For example, suppose we want to analyze the average speed of a vehicle over a given distance. The data may show that the vehicle traveled at different speeds over different sections of the distance. In this case, we can use the harmonic mean to calculate the average speed of the vehicle over the entire distance.\n","\n","Another example where harmonic mean can be used is when we want to calculate the average fuel economy of a vehicle that has different fuel efficiencies over different sections of a journey. In this case, the fuel efficiency can be measured in miles per gallon, and the harmonic mean can be used to calculate the average fuel efficiency of the vehicle over the entire journey.\n","\n","In summary, geometric mean is used when the data is logarithmically distributed, while harmonic mean is used when the data is rate-based or has a reciprocal relationship. These measures are useful in situations where the data is non-normal or skewed, and can provide insights into the central tendency of the data that may be missed by the arithmetic mean."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"548db1fe","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002199,"end_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.435313","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.433114","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Geometric View of different type of mean\n","<center>\n","Let’s see a very interesting relationship between arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic mean using geometry:\n","<img src =\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qWgOkWMFfug2w1GR.jpg\"></center>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7d252d24","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001986,"end_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.439619","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.437633","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["We can easily conclude here AM>GM>HM.\n","\n","Let’s see a summary table for all the central tendency measure.\n","<center><img src=\"https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/average/average_diagram.png.webp\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d0bb81ba","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002009,"end_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.443819","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-17T20:03:36.44181","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Here are some real-world examples of when to use geometric and harmonic means:\n","\n","1. Geometric Mean: \n","Suppose you are an investor and you want to calculate the average annual return of an investment over several years. The investment may have shown a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the years, which means that the return has grown exponentially over time. In this case, you can use the geometric mean to calculate the average annual return of the investment.\n","\n","* For example, \n","if the investment grew by 20% in year 1, 30% in year 2, and 15% in year 3, the geometric mean return would be the cube root of (1.2 x 1.3 x 1.15) - 1, which is about 21.3%. This is a more accurate measure of the average annual return than the arithmetic mean, which would be (20% + 30% + 15%) / 3 = 21.7%.\n","\n","2. Harmonic Mean: \n","Suppose you are a delivery driver and you want to calculate your average speed over a delivery route that has different speed limits over different sections. In this case, you can use the harmonic mean to calculate your average speed over the entire route.\n","\n","* For example, \n","if you drove 50 miles at 60 miles per hour and then 50 miles at 40 miles per hour, the harmonic mean speed would be (2/((1/60) + (1/40))) = 48 miles per hour.

It has the capability to summarize the set of observations around a central value. In summary, we can say that mean is an average value median is the center value, and mode is the most frequent value in the set of observations.
